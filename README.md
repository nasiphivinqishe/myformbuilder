# My Form Builder

This App is a Form Builder App, it allows user to chose type of input, customize/style them and put them into form. It uses REACT Hooks as State Management Mechanism. The STYLE of input needs to be put in Normal HTML format e.g border-radius not borderRadius as one would in REACT. After a person has done adding and customizing inputs to their forms, then can then download the form in a Text file, which they can use it to their app of choice or whatever the need is.
